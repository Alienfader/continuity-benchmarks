# run-id-rag-parity.sh — ID-RAG parity matrix for peer-review credibility.
#
# Matrix (current settings — edit FIXTURES / MODELS / RUNS / RUNNERS to widen):
#   2 fixtures × 2 models × 3 runs × 2 runners = 24 invocations
#   Each invocation sweeps all 3 conditions (baseline / continuity / continuity-in-loop)
#   Estimated total cost ~$15-25; wall time ~1.5-2 hours sequentially.
#
# Outputs land in benchmarks/reports/id-rag-parity/<fixture>/<model>/run-<n>/
# Per-invocation log: benchmarks/reports/id-rag-parity/run.log
#
# Overwrite guard: cells whose output JSON already exists are skipped by
# default to protect prior matrix data. To re-run a populated matrix from
# scratch, invoke with `FORCE=1 scripts/run-id-rag-parity.sh` or delete
# the target cells under reports/id-rag-parity/ first.
#
# Runtime: tsx (installed as devDependency).
#
set -uo pipefail   # NOT -e: we want to continue past any single-invocation failure
